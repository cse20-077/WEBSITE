                    Thai is a month in Tamil calendar, and Pusam is the name of a star. 
                    During the month of Thai, Pusam star is at its highest point in the sky. Thus, the Thaipusam festival is 
                    celebrated during the full moon day. In Singapore, devotees walk from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple to the 
                    Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. The celebration continues for two days, the eve of the day, and the day itself. 
                    It's a festival for the devotees to fulfil their vows. Some devotees carry spiked Kavadis (altars) that 
                    pierce through their torso while other devotees carry pots of milk that are later poured over the Vel (a divine javelin).

                    Lantern Festival or the spring lantern festival is one of the most popular festivals in Singapore. 
                    It marks the last day of celebration of the Chinese New Year (15th day). During this day, the kids carry 
                    paper lanterns outside, lit them up and release it in the sky. Some paper lanterns are simple and traditional 
                    whereas some are of different shapes and sizes. Some even have quizzes on them for the kids to solve. 
                    It's a magnificent sight to see several lanterns light up the night sky.

                        The Hungry Ghost Festival is a festival celebrated by the Buddhists and the Taoists on the 15th night of the 7th month of 
                        the Chinese calendar. It is believed that the ghosts come out during this period from the lower realms. During this 
                        festival in Singapore, people visit the graves to meet their ancestors and deceased members of the family and offer them food. 
                        Offerings are made to the spirits of the deceased to take care of their materialistic needs even in their afterlives. 
                        It is said that the ghosts make mischief if they are ignored. What's unique about the ghost festival in Singapore is 
                        that there are many entertainment sources available for the people. Large tents are set up during the festival, and 
                        many live performances are also conducted. The festival is also called Zhongyuan Festival or Yulan Festival.
