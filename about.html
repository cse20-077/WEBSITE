                Singapore is a city, a country, and a state all in one.
                It has an area of around 275 square miles, little smaller than Rhode Island, and is home to five million people from four primary ethnic groups: Chinese (majority), Malay, Indian, and Eurasian.
                The country has followed a parliamentary democracy system since gaining independence on August 9, 1965.
                Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong currently leads the government and cabinet, while President Halimah Yacob is the Head of State.<br><br>
                It is a thriving metropolis offering a world-class infrastructure, a fully integrated island-wide transportnetwork, dynamic business environment, vibrant living spaces and a rich culture largely 
                influenced by the four major communities in Singapore with each offering different perspective of life in Singapore in terms of culture, religion, food, language and history.
                It is a thriving metropolis with world-class infrastructure, a fully integrated island-wide transportation network, a dynamic business environment, vibrant living spaces, and a rich culture influenced 
                by Singapore's four major communities, each offering a unique perspective on life in the city-state in terms of culture, religion, food, language, and history.<br><br>
                The ease of life in Singapore, notably in terms of habitation, transportation, and governance, is one of the reasons for its attraction as a home. Singapore has achieved great progress in several sectors over
                the years, earning a slew of international awards that acknowledge the city as lively and world-class.<br><br>
                Whether it's through the arts and cultural exchanges, the development of cutting-edge innovation to improve the lives of communities at home and abroad, or the gathering of world-class minds to spark new 
                business opportunities locally and internationally, Singapore is simply the place where worlds collide.<br><br>

    <div class="History">
        <h2>The history of Singapore</h2><br>
        
        <p>The history of the modern state of Singapore dates back to its founding in the early nineteenth century, however evidence suggests that a significant trading settlement existed on the Island of Singapore in the 14th century.<br><br>
            At the time, the Kingdom of Singapura was under the rule of Parameswara, who killed the previous ruler before he was expelled by the Majapahit or the Siamese. It then came under the Malacca Sultanate and then the Johor Sultanate.
            In 1819, British statesman Stamford Raffles negotiated a treaty whereby Johor allowed the British to locate a trading port on the island, leading to the establishment of the crown colony of Singapore in 1819.<br><br>
            During World War II, Singapore was conquered and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. When the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, culminating in 
            Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia in 1963. However, social unrest and disputes between Singapore's ruling People's Action Party and Malaysia's Alliance Party resulted in Singapore's expulsion from
            Malaysia. Singapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.<br><br>
            Facing severe unemployment and a housing crisis, Singapore embarked on a modernisation programme beginning in the late 1960s through the 1970s that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing
            estates, and investing heavily in public education and infrastructure.<br><br>
            By the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly developed free market economy, strong international trading links. It now has the highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia,[1]
            which is 7th in the world, and it is ranked 9th on the UN Human Development Index.<br><br>
            Singapore has a colourful mix of four languages recognised by the Singapore government: English (the most widely spoken language), Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. Though the national language remains Malay,
            it is English that is used as a working language for business. On the streets of Singapore many speak Singlish, a patois language called Singapore Colloquial English by academics.<br><br>
